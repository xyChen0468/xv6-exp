in the
```
static void 
insert(int key, int value, struct entry **p, struct entry *n)
{
  struct entry *e = malloc(sizeof(struct entry));
  e->key = key;
  e->value = value;
  e->next = n;
  *p = e;
}
```
the insert process relies on the *p pointer to update.
When two threads update the same *p pointer, which is the head of the current linked list,
they may overwrite the changes made by the other thread and hence results the race condition.
